# Cycle Insight

Purpose of this project was to replace the hopeless cadence and distance sensor that came with my bike turbo. After a few weeks the only reading it output was the cadence which for the best part of Â£100 is a bit dissapointing. With this in mind I wanted to make it as cheap as possible so others could potentially build their own CI sensor in the future.

## Parts list

1. Arduino Nano
2. KY-003 Hall Effect Sensor x2
3. Single core wire
4. 3D printed bracket to fit bike chainstay
5. Long USB Mini-B to Type A
